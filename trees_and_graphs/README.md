## trees, heaps, tries, graphs

### trees

<br>

* a node is called **leaf** if it has no children.
* **binary trees**: each node has up to 2 children.
* **binary search tree**: all nodes on the left are smaller than the root, which is smaller than all nodes on the right.
	* if the bst is **balanced**, it guarantees O(log(n)) for insert and search.
* common types of balanced trees: **red-black** and **avl**.
* a **complete tree** is a tree on which every level is fully filled (except perhaps for the last).
* a **full binary tree** has each node with either zero or two children (and no node has only one child).
* a **perfect tree** is both full and complete (it must have exactly 2**k - 1 nodes, where k is the number of levels).

### breath-first search

<br>

- similar to pre-order, but work with a queue (level order problem)
- one common application of breadth-first search (BFS) is to find the shortest path from the root node to the target node.
- in the first round, we process the root node, in the second round, we process the nodes next to the root node, in the third round, we process the nodes which are two steps from the root node, etc. newly-added nodes will not be traversed immediately but will be processed in the next round.
- if node X is added to the kth round queue, the shortest path between the root node and X is exactly k.
- the processing order of the nodes in the exact same order as how they were added to the queue, which is FIFO.

### depth-first search

<br>

- similar to BFS, deep-first search (DFS) can also be used to find the path from the root node to the target node.
- overall, we only trace back and try another path after we reach the deepest node. as a result, the first path you find in DFS is not always the shortest path.
- we first push the root node to the stack, then we try the first neighbor and push its node to the stack, etc.
- when we reach the deepest node, we need to trace back. when we track back, we pop the deepest node from the stack, which is actually the last node pushed to the stack.
- the processing order of the nodes is exactly the opposite order of how they are added to the stack.
- recursion solutions are easier to implement; however, if the recursion depth is too high, stack overflow might occur. in that case, you might use BFS instead or implement DFS using an explicit stack (i.e., use a while loop and a stack structure to simulate the system call stack).
- if the depth of the tree is too large, stack overflow might happen, therefore iterative solutions might be better.
- work with stacks

#### in-order

- left -> node -> right

```python
def inorder(self, root):
        if root is None:
            return []
	return inorder(root.left) + [root.val] + inorder(root.right)
````

<br>

#### pre-order

- node -> left -> right

```python
def preorder(self, root):
        if root is None:
            return []
	return [root.val] + preorder(root.left) + preorder(root.right)
````

- top-down (parameters are passed down to children), so deserialize with a queue.


<br>

#### post-order

- left -> right -> node

```python
def postorder(self, root):
        if root is None:
            return []
	return postorder(root.left) + postorder(root.right) + [root.val] 
````

- bottom-up solution (if you know the answer of the children, can you concatenate the answer of the nodes?):
- deletion process is always post-order: when you delete a node, you will delete its left child and its right child before you delete the node itself.
- also, post-order is used in mathematical expressions as it's easier to write a program to parse a post-order expression. using a stack, each time when you meet a operator, you can just pop 2 elements from the stack, calculate the result and push the result back into the stack.

### binary heaps

<br>

* a **min heap** is a complete binary tree where each node is smaller than its children (the root is the min element). two key operations are:
 	- insert: always by the element at the bottom, at the most rightmost post
  	- extract_min: the minimum element is always on top, and removing it is the trickest part:
  	  	1. remove and swap it with the last element (the bottom most rightmost)
  	 	2. them bubble down, swapping it with one of its children until the min-heap is properly restored (there is no order between right and left and it takes O(log n) time.   

<br>

### tries

<br>

* a variant of n-ary tree in which characters are stored in each node
* each path down the tree represents a word
* the * nodes (null nodes) are often used to indicate complete words (usually represented by a special type of child) or a boolean flag that terminates the parent node
* a node can have anywhere from 1 through alphabet_size + 1 child
* can be used to store the entire english language for quick prefix lookup (O(k), where k is the length of the string)
