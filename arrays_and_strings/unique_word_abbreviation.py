'''
The abbreviation of a word is a concatenation of its first letter, 
the number of characters between the first and last letter, and its 
last letter. If a word has only two characters, then it is an abbreviation of itself.
Returns true if either of the following conditions are met (otherwise returns false):
- There is no word in dictionary whose abbreviation is equal to word's abbreviation.
- For any word in dictionary whose abbreviation is equal to word's abbreviation, 
that word and word are the same.
